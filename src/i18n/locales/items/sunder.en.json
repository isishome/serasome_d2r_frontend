      "These are Grand Charms and take up 3 inventory slots",
      "These charms will “break specific monster immunity”",
      "The tradeoff to using the six new charms when breaking a monster’s resistance is that they also reduce your own resistance to the same element",
      "Sunder Charm monster resistance reduction effects are applied before effects such as Amplify Damage or Lower Resist",
      "Sunder Charms work with minions such as Hydras and traps",
      "This was not the case when they were first revealed",
      "Sunder Charms can only be dropped by Rare, Unique, Super Unique, or Champion terrorized monster types in Terror Zones",
      "This includes Uber monsters",
      "Carrying more than one of the same charm does not stack the resistance reduction effect on monsters but does stack the player’s negative resistances",
      "Players can also carry multiple different charms but will suffer from each charm’s resistance penalty",
      "Sunder Charms can  be equipped at level 75",
      "For further reading on which immunities are present in which zones, check the Terror Zone immunities by zone list",
      "An just update prior to the Sunder Charme launch stated , “Conviction and Lower Resist effectiveness will be 1/5 effective even after a Sundering Charm’s applied effects”"
