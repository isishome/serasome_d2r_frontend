            "He will spawn at the first Super Unique monster you encounter. So you can basically choose the location to fight Uber Diablo by selecting which Super Unique you want him to replace. He is similar in appearance to Hell level Diablo and is a formidable challenge. When killed, Uber Diablo drops the only unique small charm in the game, the Annihilus. It is recommended to have high lightning and fire resistance and physical damage reduction before taking on Uber Diablo."

            "As mentioned, Uber Diablo spawns when a certain number of Stones of Jordan have been sold to merchants. This was originally intended to combat the rampant duping of SoJ's and, though it is now a somewhat antiquated problem, this is still the system used to spawn him.",
            "When a game is created in Diablo II, it is randomly created on a server or IP Address, which range from .30 to .180, for a total of 151 possible servers. Each server keeps track of the number of SoJ's sold, and Uber Diablo will walk when a certain number have been sold. The exact number is unclear, but it is generally believed to range from 75-150. There are several methods to track which servers are close to spawning Uber Diablo, the easiest of which is likely to join the chat channel Op DClone. The most difficult part of camping an Uber Diablo spawn is landing a game in the correct server. To determine which server your game is on, make sure you are in the game, tab out to your desktop, and click the Start button on your Windows taskbar. Choose (or type in) Run and type in cmd. This will open a command prompt, into which you 'type':",
            "netstat â€“n | find '4000'",
            "This will cause a line of numbers to appear. Your server number is the number that appears directly before :4000 at the end of the line. Now all that's left to do is repeat this process until you create a game in the appropriate server. It should be noted that servers are realm specific, so an Uber Diablo spawn on server .45 on USWest will not necessarily correlate to a spawn on .45 on USEast."
